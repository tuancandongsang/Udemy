<h2>Instructions</h2>

Clone this repository with

    git clone git@github.com:michaelcheng429/backbone_tutorial_blogroll_app.git
    
For the first part of this tutorial (the clientside code only), use the `part1-clientside-code` branch:

    git checkout part1-clientside-code
    
From this branch, simply open the `index.html` file and look around at the code in the files.

For the complete app, including serverside, use the master branch, make sure MongoDB is running by running `mongod` from the MongoDB directory, and then type in the terminal:

    node server
    
Then, open up `http://localhost:3000` to view and play with the app.

<h2>Hope this helps!</h2>

And have fun!
